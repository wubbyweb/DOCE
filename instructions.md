1. Core Functional Parts of Your Application
To build an AI-powered invoice scanning and contract validation solution, you’ll need to address several functional areas:

**Invoice Ingestion

Accept invoices from multiple sources: email, uploads (PDF, JPEG, TIFF), scans, etc.

**Data Extraction

Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI to extract key invoice fields: invoice number, date, vendor, line items, totals, etc.

Employ NLP (Natural Language Processing - using Google services) to understand context and handle diverse layouts and languages.

**Contract Retrieval

Fetch the corresponding contract for each invoice, from a directory.

**Invoice-Contract Matching & Validation

Use AI to cross-check invoice details (amounts, dates, line items, terms) against contract terms.

Flag discrepancies: mismatched amounts, unauthorized vendors, duplicate invoices, etc.

**Workflow Automation

Route invoices for manual review/approval if needed, based on predefined rules (e.g., high-value invoices, mismatches).


**Audit & Compliance

Log all actions for traceability.

Generate reports for compliance, audits, and analytics.

**User Interface

Dashboard for AP teams to review, approve, or resolve flagged invoices.


2. Technical Architecture Plan
Here’s a high-level technical architecture for your solution:

Frontend	React/Vue/Angular, Web UI, Invoice upload, dashboard, review & approval workflows
API Layer	REST/GraphQL APIs	Connect frontend to backend services
AI/ML Layer	OCR Engine (Google Vision), NLP Models	Extract and interpret invoice data
Backend	Python/Node.js, Use Microsoft Semantic Kernel Agentic framework,	Business logic, validation, workflow orchestration
Database	SQL/NoSQL (Postgres, MongoDB)	Store invoices, contracts, audit logs
Contract Storage	Document Store (local tmp storage)	storage and retrieval of contract documents
Integration	ERP, Accounting, Email, Cloud Storage	Fetch contracts, push approved invoices, automate workflows

**Key AI/ML Considerations:

Use existing google service APIs for image extraction
Use Micrsoft Semantic kernel for agentic implementation. The framework should have an orchestrator agent, use and create required tools,
