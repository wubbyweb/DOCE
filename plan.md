# AI-Powered Invoice Validation Application Plan (GCP Focused)

**Project Goal:** Develop an application that ingests invoices, extracts data using AI, retrieves corresponding contracts, validates invoice details against contract terms using AI, flags discrepancies, facilitates workflow automation for approvals, and ensures auditability and compliance.

**1. Core Functional Components:**

*   **Invoice Ingestion:** Accept invoices via various methods (email, file uploads - PDF, JPEG, TIFF, scans).
*   **Data Extraction:** Utilize OCR and AI/NLP to extract key fields (invoice #, date, vendor, line items, totals) from diverse layouts and languages.
*   **Contract Retrieval:** Fetch associated contracts from a designated storage system (e.g., Document Management System, ERP, Google Cloud Storage).
*   **Invoice-Contract Matching & Validation:** Employ AI to compare invoice data against contract terms, identifying mismatches (amounts, items, terms, unauthorized vendors, duplicates).
*   **Workflow Automation:** Route invoices for review/approval based on rules (e.g., high value, mismatches) and integrate with payment systems.
*   **Audit & Compliance:** Log all actions for traceability and generate compliance/audit reports.
*   **User Interface:** Provide a dashboard for Accounts Payable teams to manage invoices and admin tools for configuration/monitoring.

**4. High-Level Implementation Steps (with detailed AI focus):**

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Ingestion (GCP Focus)**
    *   Initialize project repository (Git).
    *   Set up Google Cloud Project, enable necessary APIs (Cloud Storage, Cloud Run/GKE, Document AI, Vertex AI, Cloud SQL/Firestore).
    *   Configure Cloud Storage bucket for invoices and contracts.
    *   Set up basic IAM roles.
    *   Develop `invoice-ingestion-service` (Cloud Run/Function triggered by Cloud Storage upload, or API endpoint via Cloud API Gateway). Store metadata in DB (Cloud SQL/Firestore).
    *   Set up `api-gateway` (Google Cloud API Gateway) to route initial requests.
    *   Create initial database schema (Cloud SQL/Firestore).
    *   Build a minimal `frontend` for file uploads (e.g., using Cloud Storage signed URLs).
    *   Containerize services using Docker (for GKE/Cloud Run).
*   **Phase 2: Data Extraction (Google Document AI)**
    *   **Configure Document AI:** Create an Invoice Processor in the Google Cloud Console. Note the Processor ID.
    *   **Develop `data-extraction-service`:**
        *   Trigger this service upon successful invoice ingestion (e.g., via Pub/Sub notification from the Cloud Storage bucket).
        *   Use the Google Cloud Client Libraries to call the Document AI API, passing the invoice file path (in Cloud Storage) and the Processor ID.
        *   Receive and parse the structured `Document` object response from Document AI, which contains entities (key-value pairs), line items, etc., along with confidence scores.
        *   Map the extracted and parsed data to your application's database schema. Store confidence scores for potential use in validation rules.
        *   Implement error handling for Document AI processing failures.
    *   Update `frontend` to display extracted data retrieved from the application's database.
*   **Phase 3: Contract Handling (Basic)** (Largely unchanged, but use Cloud Storage)
    *   Develop `contract-retrieval-service`. Initially, allow manual upload/linking via UI, storing contracts in the designated Cloud Storage bucket.
    *   Define contract data model and database schema (Cloud SQL/Firestore).
*   **Phase 4: Validation Logic (Rule-Based)** (Unchanged)
    *   Develop `validation-service` for initial rule-based checks (vendor match, amount tolerance, date validity).
    *   Flag discrepancies in the database.
    *   Update `frontend` to show validation status.
*   **Phase 5: Basic Workflow & UI Enhancement** (Unchanged)
    *   Develop `workflow-service` for status tracking.
    *   Enhance `frontend` dashboard for review and manual actions.
*   **Phase 6: Refinement & Advanced Features (Iterative with Vertex AI)**
    *   **AI Validation (Vertex AI):**
        *   **Data Prep:** Collect labeled training data (invoice fields, relevant contract clauses/metadata, validation outcomes) and store it in BigQuery or Cloud Storage.
        *   **Model Training:**
            *   Use **Vertex AI AutoML Tables** for simpler validation tasks based on structured extracted data (e.g., predicting mismatch probability based on vendor, amounts, dates).
            *   For complex contract term matching or line-item validation, use **Vertex AI Custom Training**. Develop models using TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn. Explore techniques like:
                *   Semantic similarity using pre-built embeddings (e.g., Universal Sentence Encoder on Vertex AI) to compare invoice line items descriptions with contract terms.
                *   Fine-tuning language models (e.g., Gemini, BERT via Vertex AI) for deeper understanding of contract clauses.
            *   Train anomaly detection models (e.g., using Vertex AI's built-in algorithms or custom models) to flag unusual patterns.
        *   **Model Deployment:** Deploy trained models using **Vertex AI Prediction** to get scalable HTTP endpoints.
        *   **Integration:** Update `validation-service` to preprocess data and call the appropriate Vertex AI Prediction endpoints. Combine rule-based results with AI model predictions.
        *   **Feedback Loop:** Build a mechanism in the `frontend` for users to correct AI flags. Feed this corrected data back into a retraining dataset (e.g., in BigQuery) and use **Vertex AI Pipelines** to automate periodic model retraining and deployment.
    *   **Email Ingestion:** Integrate with Gmail API or use SendGrid Inbound Parse to trigger `invoice-ingestion-service`.
    *   **ERP Integration:** Use Cloud Functions/Workflows or dedicated service connectors.
    *   **Workflow Rules:** Implement using `workflow-service` logic or potentially Google Cloud Workflows.
    *   **Security:** Utilize Google Identity Platform, IAM, Secret Manager.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:** Leverage Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, and potentially Cloud Trace.
    *   **Audit Trail:** Implement using Cloud Logging structured logs, potentially sinking to BigQuery for analysis.
    *   **Reporting:** Build dashboards in Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) connected to BigQuery/Cloud SQL.
    *   **Scalability:** Configure Cloud Run auto-scaling or GKE Horizontal Pod Autoscaling. Optimize database choices (e.g., Firestore vs. Cloud SQL vs. Spanner based on needs).

**5. Key Considerations (GCP Focus):**

*   **AI/ML Choice:** Leverage Google Document AI for invoice parsing for rapid development. Utilize the breadth of Vertex AI (AutoML, Custom Training, Pipelines, Prediction) for building, deploying, and managing sophisticated custom validation models.
*   **Modularity:** Maintain clear separation between microservices (deployable on Cloud Run or GKE).
*   **Configuration Management:** Use Secret Manager for secrets and potentially application configuration stored in Cloud Storage or Firestore.
*   **Testing:** Implement unit, integration (using GCP emulators where possible), and end-to-end tests.
*   **Security:** Design security using GCP best practices (IAM, VPC Service Controls, Identity Platform).
*   **Cost Management:** Monitor GCP costs closely, especially for AI/ML services and database usage. Choose appropriate service tiers and scaling settings.
